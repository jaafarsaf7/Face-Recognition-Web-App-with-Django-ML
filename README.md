# Face-Recognition-Web-App-with-Django-ML


This repository contains the source code for a face recognition and facial emotion detection web application developed using Django, Machine Learning, and OpenCV. It represents a student project aimed at exploring the integration of machine learning models within a web-based interface and deploying it to the cloud.


## Project Overview
Cloud Deployment: The application is designed to be hosted on Heroku, showcasing a practical deployment scenario for web applications powered by machine learning.
Machine Learning: Custom models have been trained for both face recognition and facial emotion detection.
Django Framework: The web interface and backend are built using Django's MVT framework, offering scalability and ease of integration.
Database: This project uses SQLite as its database, managed within the Django environment.
Frontend: The interface is styled using Bootstrap, providing a responsive and modern look.



## Features:
Face Recognition: Identify and differentiate between faces in uploaded images.
Facial Emotion Recognition: Detect and label emotions on recognized faces.
OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks essential for face recognition.
ML Model Integration: The application integrates trained Support Vector Machines and Random Forest models, with exploration into ensemble techniques.
Heroku Deployment: Steps and scripts for deploying the web app onto Heroku cloud.
